#CODEBOOK
This CodeBook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that was performed to clean up  the source data to create 
a tidy dataset as per requirements.

# About the Data
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
