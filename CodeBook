#CODEBOOK
This CodeBook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that was performed to clean up  the source data to create 
a tidy dataset as per requirements.

#### About the Data
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  
Each person performed six activities `(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)` wearing   
a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial   
linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.   
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned   
into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
